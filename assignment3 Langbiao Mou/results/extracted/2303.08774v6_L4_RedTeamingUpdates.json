      "evidence_span": "We refer to these adversarial testing processes informally as “red teaming” in line with the deﬁnition given in [ 27], namely “a structured eﬀort to ﬁnd ﬂaws and vulnerabilities in a plan, organization, or technical system, often performed by dedicated ’red teams’ that seek to adopt an attacker’s mindset and methods.”",

      "evidence_span": "We subjected the model to stress testing, boundary testing, and red teaming in four dual-use domains to explore whether our models could provide the necessary information to proliferators seeking to develop, acquire, or disperse nuclear, radiological, biological, and chemical weapons.",
