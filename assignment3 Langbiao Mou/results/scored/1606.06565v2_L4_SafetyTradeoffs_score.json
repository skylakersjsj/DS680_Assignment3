  "score": 2,
  "rationale": "The claims provide strong, explicit evidence that the document articulates safety objectives and trade-offs. The first claim directly discusses balancing safety and performance, emphasizing a unified approach to prevent unintended harm in autonomous systems. The second claim explicitly highlights a trade-off between risk and capability in exploratory actions. The third claim addresses adapting models to new situations, implying trade-offs between safety and generalization. Together, these claims clearly and explicitly support the indicator's focus on articulated safety objectives and trade-offs."
