  "rationale": "The claim discusses fine-tuning with data from different domains and obtaining meaningful gradients, but it does not address safety aspects, which are a core requirement of the indicator 'Domain-specific fine-tunes with safety'. The evidence is generic regarding cross-domain fine-tuning and lacks any mention of safety measures, evaluations, or mitigations."
