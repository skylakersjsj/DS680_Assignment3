1606.06565v2,L4_SafetyTradeoffs,2,"The claims provide strong, explicit evidence that the document articulates safety objectives and trade-offs. The first claim directly discusses balancing safety and performance, emphasizing a unified approach to prevent unintended harm in autonomous systems. The second claim explicitly highlights a trade-off between risk and capability in exploratory actions. The third claim addresses adapting models to new situations, implying trade-offs between safety and generalization. Together, these claims clearly and explicitly support the indicator's focus on articulated safety objectives and trade-offs."
gpt-4-system-card,L4_SafetyTradeoffs,2,"The claims provide strong, explicit evidence that the document articulates safety objectives and trade-offs. Multiple claims directly reference specific trade-offs: (1) balancing risk minimization with enabling positive use cases (safety vs. capability), (2) acknowledging that safety challenges don't necessarily outweigh benefits, (3) trade-offs in risk assessment due to biased red team selection, (4) limitations of current mitigations requiring future planning (current capabilities vs. future safety), and (5) acceleration risk highlighting trade-offs between rapid development and safety standards. The evidence spans multiple sections of the document and explicitly discusses the tension between competing objectives, meeting the criteria for strong evidence."
2303.08774v6,L4_RedTeamingUpdates,1,"The claims provide partial evidence that red-teaming informs alignment updates, but lack explicit details on how findings directly lead to specific model updates. While the document describes red-teaming processes, iterative testing, risk identification, and mitigation efforts (e.g., technical mitigations and policy levers), it does not clearly demonstrate that these red-teaming results are used to update the model's alignment or safety mechanisms. The evidence is more focused on the general process and outcomes of red-teaming rather than its direct impact on alignment updates."
Claude Sonnet 4.5,L4_RedTeamingUpdates,0,"The claims provide evidence about red-teaming evaluations and security improvements, but none demonstrate that red-teaming specifically informed alignment updates. The claims show: 1) Performance improvements on malicious/dual-use cases, 2) Benchmark results showing low prompt injection rates, 3) MCP resilience testing, and 4) Plans to strengthen defenses based on external partners. However, there is no explicit connection showing that red-teaming findings directly led to alignment updates or model changes. The evidence describes evaluation outcomes and defensive improvements but lacks the causal link required by the indicator - that red-teaming informs alignment updates."
1912.02164v4,L4_DomainFineTunes,0,"The claim discusses fine-tuning with data from different domains and obtaining meaningful gradients, but it does not address safety aspects, which are a core requirement of the indicator 'Domain-specific fine-tunes with safety'. The evidence is generic regarding cross-domain fine-tuning and lacks any mention of safety measures, evaluations, or mitigations."
Various Open-Source LLMs,L4_DomainFineTunes,2,"The document provides strong, explicit evidence for domain-specific fine-tuning with safety considerations. All six claims directly support the indicator with clear evidence spans showing: 1) the necessity of fine-tuning LLMs for the Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) domain, 2) the use of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, 3) development of specialized LLMs for EHS applications, 4) construction of custom EHS datasets from regulatory sources and professionals, 5) testing on real-world EHS scenarios, and 6) emphasis on accuracy and reliability requirements for safety-critical applications. The evidence explicitly addresses both domain-specific fine-tuning (EHS domain) and safety considerations (EHS requires high accuracy and reliability), making this strong support for the indicator."
2025_pilot_risk_report,L4_RollbackMechanisms,0,"The claim describes data integrity and audit trail processes for training data verification, which relates to data governance but does not address model update or rollback mechanisms. Indicator L4_RollbackMechanisms specifically requires evidence about procedures for updating models and rolling back to previous versions if issues arise. The provided evidence about immutable audit trails for data versions is not relevant to model version control, deployment rollbacks, or model update procedures."
NIPS-2015-hidden-technical-debt-in-machine-learning-systems-Paper,L4_RollbackMechanisms,0,"The claims provided do not directly address model update or rollback mechanisms. They discuss versioning of data signals and recovery from production incidents in general, which are related to data management and incident response but not specific to rolling back model updates or reverting to previous model versions. No explicit mention of model rollback processes, tools, or mechanisms is made."
1-s2.0-S2666920X2300019X-main,L4_PedagogyEvidence,0,"None of the provided claims contain evidence of documented pedagogy. The claims focus on evaluating ChatGPT's performance in generating reflective writing, discussing risks to student skill development, and proposing computational classifiers for detecting AI-generated content. While these topics relate to educational technology and assessment, they do not provide evidence of actual pedagogical approaches, methods, or instructional strategies being implemented and documented. The claims describe research findings about AI capabilities and implications, but lack any description of pedagogical practices, teaching methods, or instructional designs that would constitute pedagogy evidence."
ai-report,L4_PedagogyEvidence,0,"All claims reference page 23, which is not among the selected pages [5, 68, 71, 27, 60] provided in the metadata. Therefore, the evidence cannot be verified against the actual document content, and no valid evidence is available for scoring this indicator."
