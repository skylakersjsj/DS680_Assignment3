The focus is more on the diversity of the training data rather than the quality assurance processes.\n\nADA Scoring:\nThe evidence indicates a focus on the diversity of training data, specifically in terms of content types and languages. However, there is no mention of any structured QA processes such as sampling reviews, gold standards, consistency metrics, or error analysis. Additionally, there is no evidence of diversity assessment related to user groups or label distributions.

These activities indicate an effort to ensure data quality and reliability. Additionally, there is mention of error analysis through systematic spot checks, which suggests some level of QA practice. However, the QA processes appear fragmented and lack comprehensive elements such as gold standards, consistency metrics, and a thorough diversity assessment. The absence of user group diversity and label distribution reports further highlights the limited scope of the QA processes. While there are some QA activities in place, they do not form a cohesive or reusable QA workflow, fitting the criteria for a score of 1, indicating that only 'a little' QA has been done.",
